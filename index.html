    <p>The Global Destination Application that I wrote was initially very limited in its capabilities. The starting form of this application would only open up and give a basic slideshow of the destination locations, with everything hard-coded in python. I decided to take this small application and expand it with a larger one written in C# for Windows PC's. My experience with C# was limited to small project that I had done on my own, and my experience with gui's in C# was with the Windows Forms. For this project however, I chose to use the WPF forms as they are a more modern solution. </p>
